<p>This document serves to document my contributions to TopDeck, the project I worked on
as part of our introductory software engineering module in NUS.
TopDeck is a flash card application built on top of the code from
<a href="https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY1819S1/addressbook-level4">Addressbook Level 4</a>.</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This section summarises my key contributions to TopDeck:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Major Enhancement</strong>: I added state to the user interface.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>What it does: A stateful interface looks and behave differently depending
on the state of the applicaton.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Justification: Having state in the user interface enhances usability in
many ways. It offers a useful mental model for users by exposing features
only when they are relevant to what a user is currently doing. It allows
us to assign multiple related features to the same command word (since
they can be disambiguated by state), minimizing the total number of unique
commands words. It also leads to shorter commands in general since TopDeck
does not have to request information from users that may be already be
inferred from the current state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Highlights: AB4 could not be readily adapted to support state because it
was designed around assumptions that do not hold with a stateful user
interface in full generality. AB4 has a static user interface that assumes
there always exists a list of items. This assumption runs so deep that
first-class access to <code>filteredList</code> and <code>selectedItem</code> is provided
through the <code>Model</code> API. So I had to rewrite <code>Model</code>. I also had to modify
many subsystems (such as parsing) along the pipeline of a typical command
execution. As a result of my work, the rest of my team could work on their
features independently and easily integrate their work through the new API
I designed.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Minor Enhancement</strong>: I added argument completion to the edit card command</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>What it does: The edit card command has an abbreviated form <code>edit INDEX</code>.
This prefills the command box with an expanded command which, if submitted
verbatim, leaves the card at <code>INDEX</code> unchanged.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Justification: This feature is meant to be a shortcut for making small
edits. Suppose a user notices a typo in a question. Instead of retyping
the entire question, they can quickly expand all arguments to the edit
command and edit the question from there.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Highlights: This is the only new feature in TopDeck that interacts with
the command box and is made possible with
<code>PrefillCommandBoxCommandResult</code> which extends <code>CommandResult</code> and holds
the string to be prefilled. In general, commands that need to interact
with <code>UI</code> through <code>MainWindow</code> do so by returning an appropriate subclass
of <code>CommandResult</code>.</p>

<h4 id="introduction"><a class="link" href="#introduction">7.1.1. Introduction</a></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>TopDeck has a stateful user interface.
This means that the set of valid commands and their respective functionality
depend on the context of the application state.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, the command word <code>add</code> is "overloaded" with two capabilities:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>In decks view, it adds a new deck: <code>add DECK_NAME</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In cards view, it adds a new card to a particular deck: <code>add q/QUESTION a/ANSWER</code></p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is the active state in TopDeck that resolves the actual command that is called.
Also, TopDeck does not request information from the user that is already implicit in the state
(e.g. the target deck in the second command).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The reasons for choosing to implement a stateful user interface are manifold.
Most importantly, it is necessary to support the implementation of study view which is stateful in nature.
A stateful user interface is also preferable to end users since it
requires less cognitive effort to operate by virtue of the fewer and shorter commands.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, implementing state in full generality required nontrivial modifications to the AB4 architecture.
We will now describe how state is implemented in TopDeck.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="current-implementation"><a class="link" href="#current-implementation">7.1.2. Current implementation</a></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>States partition the functionalities that are exposed to users.
Hence, it is natural to consider distinct views in the user interface as separate states.
States in TopDeck correspond to the three possible views described in the user guide:
decks view, cards view and study view.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The following figure illustrates the transitions between these states.</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="../images/state_diagram.png" alt="state diagram">
</div>
<div class="title">Figure 1. State diagram for TopDeck</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Each state implements a common interface <code>ViewState</code>
and holds transient data that is relevant only while the state is active.
For example, <code>CardsView</code> has a member <code>activeDeck</code> which holds a reference to the deck opened in decks view.
Commands in cards view such as <code>add</code> will then operate on this deck.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><code>ModelManager</code> owns the sole instance of <code>ViewState</code>.
Having only one instance of any state makes it trivial to enforce mutual exclusion.
The <code>Model</code> is also responsible for executing state transitions.
Each transition is exposed as a method in the <code>Model</code> API.
For example, <code>Model#changeDeck(Deck deck)</code> implements the transition from decks view to cards view.
As state entry is handled by the constructors of each state,
the implementation of a transition is as simple as constructing a new state object.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Technically, <code>Model#changeDeck(Deck deck)</code> can be called from any state, not just decks view.
This is a consequence of the design of <code>Model</code>.
The <code>Model</code> API is designed such that no state tracking is necessary.
All methods are expected to work regardless of the current state.
We assume that if a caller is capable of providing the required arguments to a method,
the method call is valid and expected.
This obviates the need for state-checking code in <code>ModelManager</code>.</p>
