== Introduction

Welcome to the developer guide.
This guide serves as a repository of useful information for anyone contributing to TopDeck.

To get started, proceed to <<Setting up>> to set up your development environment.
<<Design>> provides a high-level overview of the design and architecture of TopDeck.
<<Implementation>> discusses specific implementation details of some features.
<<Documentation>>, <<Testing>> and <<Dev Ops>> describe the procedures involved in pushing a feature to production.

== Setting up

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `9`* or later
+
[WARNING]
JDK `10` on Windows will fail to run tests in <<UsingGradle#Running-Tests, headless mode>> due to a https://github.com/javafxports/openjdk-jfx/issues/66[JavaFX bug].
Windows developers are highly recommended to use JDK `9`.

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.
. Open link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow.java`] and check for any code errors
.. Due to an ongoing https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-189060[issue] with some of the newer versions of IntelliJ, code errors may be detected even if the project can be built and run successfully
.. To resolve this, place your cursor over any of the code section highlighted in red. Press kbd:[ALT + ENTER], and select `Add '--add-modules=...' to module compiler options` for each error
. Repeat this for the test folder as well (e.g. check link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/ui/HelpWindowTest.java[`HelpWindowTest.java`] for code errors, and if so, resolve it the same way)

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `seedu.address.MainApp` and try a few commands
. <<Testing,Run the tests>> to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, the documentation will still have the SE-EDU branding and refer to the `se-edu/addressbook-level4` repo.

If you plan to develop this fork as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to `se-edu/addressbook-level4`), you should do the following:

. Configure the <<Docs-SiteWideDocSettings, site-wide documentation settings>> in link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`], such as the `site-name`, to suit your own project.

. Replace the URL in the attribute `repoURL` in link:{repoURL}/docs/DeveloperGuide.adoc[`DeveloperGuide.adoc`] and link:{repoURL}/docs/UserGuide.adoc[`UserGuide.adoc`] with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

After setting up Travis, you can optionally set up coverage reporting for your team fork (see <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Coverage reporting could be useful for a team repository that hosts the final version but it is not that useful for your personal fork.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding, get some sense of the overall design by reading <<Design-Architecture>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::Architecture.png[width="600"]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command
image::SDforDeletePerson.png[width="800"]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::TopDeckUIClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `BrowserPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `TopDeckParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a deck).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::TopDeckModelComponentClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the TopDeck data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Card>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::TopDeckStorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the TopDeck data in json format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

=== Stateful user interface
==== Introduction

TopDeck has a stateful user interface.
This means that the set of valid commands and their respective functionality
depend on the context of the application state.

For example, the command word `add` is "overloaded" with two capabilities:

1. In decks view, it adds a new deck: `add DECK_NAME`
2. In cards view, it adds a new card to a particular deck: `add q/QUESTION a/ANSWER`

It is the active state in TopDeck that resolves the actual command that is called.
Also, TopDeck does not request information from the user that is already implicit in the state
(e.g. the target deck in the second command).

The reasons for choosing to implement a stateful user interface are manifold.
Most importantly, it is necessary to support the implementation of study view which is stateful in nature.
A stateful user interface is also preferable to end users since it
requires less cognitive effort to operate by virtue of the fewer and shorter commands.

However, implementing state in full generality required nontrivial modifications to the AB4 architecture.
We will now describe how state is implemented in TopDeck.

==== Current implementation

States partition the functionalities that are exposed to users.
Hence, it is natural to consider distinct views in the user interface as separate states.
States in TopDeck correspond to the three possible views described in the user guide:
decks view, cards view and study view.

The following figure illustrates the transitions between these states.

.State diagram for TopDeck
image::state_diagram.png[]
////
[plantuml]
....
(*) --> "Decks view"
"Decks view" -> [Open] "Cards view"
"Cards view" --> [Close] "Decks view"
"Decks view" --> [Study] "Study view"
"Study view" -> [Finish study] "Decks view"
....
////

Each state implements a common interface `ViewState`
and holds transient data that is relevant only while the state is active.
For example, `CardsView` has a member `activeDeck` which holds a reference to the deck opened in decks view.
Commands in cards view such as `add` will then operate on this deck.

`ModelManager` owns the sole instance of `ViewState`.
Having only one instance of any state makes it trivial to enforce mutual exclusion.
The `Model` is also responsible for executing state transitions.
Each transition is exposed as a method in the `Model` API.
For example, `Model#changeDeck(Deck deck)` implements the transition from decks view to cards view.
As state entry is handled by the constructors of each state,
the implementation of a transition is as simple as constructing a new state object.

Technically, `Model#changeDeck(Deck deck)` can be called from any state, not just decks view.
This is a consequence of the design of `Model`.
The `Model` API is designed such that no state tracking is necessary.
All methods are expected to work regardless of the current state.
We assume that if a caller is capable of providing the required arguments to a method,
the method call is valid and expected.
This obviates the need for state-checking code in `ModelManager`.


=== Deck management
==== Data structure implementation

A Deck consists of a list of `cards`. Decks are deemed as equal if they have the same name. This
is to prevent users from creating 2 or more decks with the same name.

Within the Model, `Deck` is encapsulated by the following data structure:

* `Model`
* `VersionedTopDeck`
* `TopDeck`
* `UniqueDeckList`
* `Deck`

The Create, Read, Update and Delete(CRUD) operation will trickle down the encapsulations
and be executed in `UniqueDeckList`.

==== Current implementation

Deck Management is facilitated by `Deck` which implements the following operations:

* adddeck(Deck deck)
* editdeck(Deck deck)
* deletedeck(Deck deck)
* select(Deck toSelect)

The CRUD operations are exposed in the Model interface as `Model#addDeck(Deck deck)` and
`Model#deleteDeck(Deck toDelete)`. For each deck operation,
there are 2 main updates that need to be done. The first update will be on the model
and the second will be on the `ViewState`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the addDeck(Deck) mechanism behaves at each step:

1. The user starts up the application and is in the `DecksView`. The user then
executes the `addDeck` command `adddeck n/NAME` to create a new deck. The `adddeck` command
is parsed and calls `Model#addDeck(Deck deck)`.

2. `Model#addDeck(Deck deck)` first checks if the current state is a
DecksView. Following, it will create a new deck to be added into `VersionedTopDeck.addDeck(Deck deck).

3. Once that is done, the filteredItems list is being updated to reflect the change.

4. To continue to add `cards`, the user will then execute the command `select INDEX`. For example, user
executes the `select 1` command to select the first deck. This should change the `ViewState` in the
`ModelManager` from `DeckView` to `CardView`. For more information on `cards`, refer to cards's feature.

// tag::card[]
=== Card management
==== Data structure

A Card consists of a question, an answer and the respective tags associated with it.
Card's are deemed as equal if they have the same question to prevent the user from
creating same question twice or to have 2 different answer for the same question.
Cards are stored inside a `Deck` as a list of unique cards.
The Create, Read, Update and Delete (CRUD) operation of a card in a chosen `Deck` is thus a modification of
the chosen `Deck`.

In order to facilitate the CRUD operations, `CardsView` contains `activeDeck` which is a reference to the
current deck that we are modifying.

[NOTE]
Before any Card related operation can be executed, `ViewState` in ModelManager has to be of type `CardsView`.
For more information refer to the section on ViewState management.

==== Current implementation

Card management is currently facilitated by `Model` which implements the following operations:

* hasCard(Card card, Deck deck)
* addCard(Card card, Deck deck)
* removeCard(Card target, Deck deck)
* editCard(Card newCard, Deck deck)

The CRUD operations are exposed in the Model interface as `Model#addCard(Card card, Deck deck)`,
`Model#deleteCard(Card target, Deck deck)` and `Model#setCard(Card target, Card newCard, Deck deck)`. For each operation,
there are 2 objects that need to be updated namely, `VersionedTopDeck` and `CardsView`.

Each CRUD operation can be broken down into the following steps:

1. Find the chosen deck using `CardsView.activeDeck` and create a new deck from it.
2. Execute `VersionedTopDeck#addCard(Card newCard, Deck deck)` or
`VersionedTopDeck#removeCard(Card target, Deck deck)` or
`VersionedTopDeck#setCard(Card target, Card editedCard, Deck deck)` using `CardsView.activeDeck`.
3. Update the `CardsView` with the new editedDeck.
4. Update the UI to reflect the new CardsView.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the CRUD operation works and how it
interacts with Undo/Redo:

Step 1. The user starts up the application and is in the `DecksView`. The user then
executes the `open 1` command to open the first deck(D1 in the figure). This should change the
`ViewState` in the `ModelManager` from `DeckView` to `CardsView` and causes
`CardsView.activeDeck` to point to the first deck as per figure 1. For more information, refer to
Deck's feature.

image::card_dg_diagrams/card_diag_1.png[width="800", caption="Figure 1"]

Step 2. The user executes `add q/question a/answer` to add the new card into the current deck.
The `add` command is parsed and calls `Model#addCard(Card card, Deck deck)`.
`VersionedTopDeck(Card newCard, Deck deck)` is then called. D3 which is a copy
of D1 is created and the new card is added to D3. `VersionedTopDeck` is then updated
as per figure 2 by calling `UniqueDeckList.setDeck(Deck target, Deck editedDeck)`.

[NOTE]
All other CRUD operations works the same except for the model call. Instead of
`Model#addCard(Card card, Deck deck)`, `Model#deleteCard(Card target, Deck deck)` or
`Model#setCard(Card target, Card newCard, Deck deck)` is called instead.

image::card_dg_diagrams/card_diag_2.png[width="800", caption="Figure 2"]

Step 3. Next, the CardsView is updated creating a new `CardsView` that points to D3
as in figure 3.

image::card_dg_diagrams/card_diag_3.png[width="800", caption="Figure 3"]

Step 4. Once that is done, the `ModelManager.filteredItems` list and the UI is being updated to
reflect the change.

Step 5. Now the user executes `undo`. This results in the the CurrentStatePointer to point
to the previous TopDeck as per figure 4.

image::card_dg_diagrams/card_diag_4.png[width="800", caption="Figure 4"]

Step 6. Using D3, the application will get D1 in the TopDeck that is pointed to by CurrentStatePointer.
A new CardsView(CardsView3) is then created and points to D1 as per figure 5. The application
then updates `ModelManager.filteredItems` and the UI is being updated.

image::card_dg_diagrams/card_diag_5.png[width="800", caption="Figure 5"]

Step 7. Now, the user executes redo. This results in the the CurrentStatePointer to point
to the next TopDeck as per figure 6.

image::card_dg_diagrams/card_diag_6.png[width="800", caption="Figure 6"]

Step 8. Using D1, the application will get D3 in the TopDeck that is pointed to by CurrentStatePointer.
   A new CardsView(CardsView4) is then created and points to D3 as per figure 7. The application
   then updates `ModelManager.filteredItems` and the UI is being updated.

image::card_dg_diagrams/card_diag_7.png[width="800", caption="Figure 7"]

Step 9. Below is the final state of `ModelManager`:

image::card_dg_diagrams/card_diag_8.png[width="800", caption="Figure 8"]

==== Design considerations

===== Aspect: How CRUD operation should work
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Recreate the CardViews after each operation
** Pros: Leverages on the current implementation of `VersionTopDeck` making it easier to
implement.
** Cons: Constantly creating `CardsView` even with a small change.
* **Alternative 2:** CardView updates itself base on the chosen deck.
** Pros: Only has to update the pointer to the current Deck.
** Cons: As `CardsView.activeDeck` can only reference to one deck only, the current Undo/Redo feature
will have to be changed to store the previous commands and the object changed.

// end::card[]


//tag::studysessions[]
=== Study view

==== Current implementation

The purpose of the third view, study view, is to help users retain the knowledge
of their flash cards.

This is done by consecutively presenting users with random cards from the deck.
For each card, users are able to see the questions first, and then reveal the answers afterwards.

The functionality above is supported by the `StudyView` class.

**Important Variables**

This `StudyView` class two important variables:

* `currentCard` - the card which is currently being shown to the user.

* `currentStudyState` - variable which stores a `studyState` enum. The enum can be either `QUESTION` or `ANSWER`

These two important variables are continuously being altered every time the user interacts with the program,
explained in detail later.

**Observable Values**

Besides these variables, `StudyView` also makes extensive use of `ReadOnlyProperty` wrapper
to store variables which the UI has to display. This wrapper is chosen as it implements the `Observable` interface.


==== Data structure implementation

This section discusses how the two variables, `currentCard` and `studyState` are continuously modified,
and also the other variables that change as a result of these two functions.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the `study` mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. User enter study mode using `study 1` command.

A `StudyDeckCommand` is issued.

Upon the execution of this command, Model's `viewState` will now hold a `StudyView` object with 1st deck as active deck.

As part of the execution of `StudyDeckCommand`, step 2 is ran.

Step 2. Generating a question.

In order to present questions to users, these are the functions called by the `GenerateQuestionCommand()`:

* `DeckSuffler#generateCard()` The `DeckShuffler` class has an algorithm (implementation explained later)
to select a Card object, and passes this reference to `StudyView`.
 * `currentCard` refers now to that card.

* `currentState` is set to QUESTION.

* Consequently, `textShown` property is also modified. In this case, it will contain
the question  of the chosen card.

Step 2. User executes the `[wildcard]` command to signal that he has come up with the answer.

* User answer, ie whatever the user wrote, is stored as command under the statistics variable.

Step 3. The  command generates a `ShowAnswerCommand()`

The follwing are ran upon execution of the show answer command:

* `currentStudyState` to ANSWER.
* Similar to the above, we also change the `textShown` property to show user answer instead.


Step 4. User enters the difficulty rating "command" to rate how difficult they thought it was to recall
the answer.

The following things happen:

* Their answer stored under userAnswer variable, which will be displayed later.
* This is perfect as we do not want users to revert statistics by executing undo command.

* `GenerateQuestionCommand()` is executed once again. Back to Step 2.


==== UI implementation

The UI listens for three things: the `studyState`, `userAnswer`, and `textShown`.


The first is important because depending on whether it's question or answer, we
modify the colours of flash cards in the UI. This variables also specifies whether or not we need to display users'
answers and whether or not we need to prompt them to rate the difficulty.

The second is important to show the users what they answered.
The last is important to show the contents of the flash card.


==== Design considerations

===== Aspect: How to store states within  study view

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):**
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: UI just changes state based on commands issued.
* **Alternative 2: (current choice):** Use an event listener to see whether the `textShown` has changed.
Because it is easy to modify textShown immediately, there is no need for the UI to track this variable as
that would be costly.

==== UI implementation

UI uses event listeners to know the

// end::studysessions[]

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/redo feature
==== Current implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedTopDeck`.
It extends `TopDeck` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `TopDeckStateList` and `currentStatePointer`.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedTopDeck#commit()` -- Saves the current TopDeck state in its history.
* `VersionedTopDeck#undo()` -- Restores the previous TopDeck state from its history.
* `VersionedTopDeck#redo()` -- Restores a previously undone TopDeck state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitTopDeck()`, `Model#undoTopDeck()` and `Model#redoTopDeck()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedTopDeck` will be initialized with the initial TopDeck state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single TopDeck state.

image::UndoRedoStartingStateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in TopDeck. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitTopDeck()`, causing the modified state of TopDeck after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `topDeckStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted TopDeck state.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David ...` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitTopDeck()`, causing another modified TopDeck state to be saved into the `topDeckStateList`.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitTopDeck()`, so the TopDeck state will not be saved into the `topDeckStateList`.

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoTopDeck()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous TopDeck state, and restores TopDeck to that state.

image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial TopDeck state, then there are no previous TopDeck states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoTopDeck()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The `redo` command does the opposite -- it calls `Model#redoTopDeck()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores TopDeck to that state.

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `topDeckStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest TopDeck state, then there are no undone TopDeck states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoTopDeck()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify TopDeck, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitTopDeck()`, `Model#undoTopDeck()` or `Model#redoTopDeck()`. Thus, the `topDeckStateList` remains unchanged.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitTopDeck()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `topDeckStateList`, all TopDeck states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. We designed it this way because it no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David ...` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand4StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[width="650"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves all TopDeck data.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a list to store the history of TopDeck states.
** Pros: Easy for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `VersionedTopDeck`.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate list, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things.

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

[[Docs-SiteWideDocSettings]]
=== Site-wide documentation settings

The link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`] file specifies some project-specific https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#attributes[asciidoc attributes] which affects how all documentation files within this project are rendered.

[TIP]
Attributes left unset in the `build.gradle` file will use their *default value*, if any.

[cols="1,2a,1", options="header"]
.List of site-wide attributes
|===
|Attribute name |Description |Default value

|`site-name`
|The name of the website.
If set, the name will be displayed near the top of the page.
|_not set_

|`site-githuburl`
|URL to the site's repository on https://github.com[GitHub].
Setting this will add a "View on GitHub" link in the navigation bar.
|_not set_

|`site-seedu`
|Define this attribute if the project is an official SE-EDU project.
This will render the SE-EDU navigation bar at the top of the page, and add some SE-EDU-specific navigation items.
|_not set_

|===

[[Docs-PerFileDocSettings]]
=== Per-file documentation settings

Each `.adoc` file may also specify some file-specific https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#attributes[asciidoc attributes] which affects how the file is rendered.

Asciidoctor's https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#builtin-attributes[built-in attributes] may be specified and used as well.

[TIP]
Attributes left unset in `.adoc` files will use their *default value*, if any.

[cols="1,2a,1", options="header"]
.List of per-file attributes, excluding Asciidoctor's built-in attributes
|===
|Attribute name |Description |Default value

|`site-section`
|Site section that the document belongs to.
This will cause the associated item in the navigation bar to be highlighted.
One of: `UserGuide`, `DeveloperGuide`, ``LearningOutcomes``{asterisk}, `AboutUs`, `ContactUs`

_{asterisk} Official SE-EDU projects only_
|_not set_

|`no-site-header`
|Set this attribute to remove the site navigation bar.
|_not set_

|===

=== Site template

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/stylesheets[`docs/stylesheets`] are the https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS[CSS stylesheets] of the site.
You can modify them to change some properties of the site's design.

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] controls the rendering of `.adoc` files into HTML5.
These template files are written in a mixture of https://www.ruby-lang.org[Ruby] and http://slim-lang.com[Slim].

[WARNING]
====
Modifying the template files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] requires some knowledge and experience with Ruby and Asciidoctor's API.
You should only modify them if you need greater control over the site's layout than what stylesheets can provide.
The SE-EDU team does not provide support for modified template files.

[[Testing]]
== Testing

=== Running tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.address.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.address.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `HelpWindow.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

=== Build automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Coverage reporting

We use https://coveralls.io/[Coveralls] to track the code coverage of our projects. See <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>> for more details.

=== Documentation previews
When a pull request has changes to asciidoc files, you can use https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify] to see a preview of how the HTML version of those asciidoc files will look like when the pull request is merged. See <<UsingNetlify#, UsingNetlify.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, TopDeck depends on the https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson[Jackson library] for JSON parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives:

[loweralpha]
. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size)
. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)
