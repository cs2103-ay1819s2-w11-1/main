== About the Project
My team and I were tasked with morphing a basic commandline interface addressbook application(AB4) for our software
engineering project. We decided to morph the application into a Flashcard management application called TopDeck

**TopDeck** is a user-friendly flashcard management application that aims to help users better memorise any content
that they desire.
The main functionality of the application include managing a list of decks, managing the cards within
each deck and having study sessions.
Users can use it to learn a language, remember a math formula or simply recall an answer to a question.

I was in-charge of the card's management feature within the application and these include creating,
reading, updating and deleting (CRUD) a card within a deck as well as searching for cards that the user is interested in.
The following sections illustrate these enhancements as well as the relevant sections that I have included in the user and
developer guides.

== Glossary
The following symbols are used throughout the application and represent the following:

== Summary of Contributions
This section shows a summary of my coding, documentation, and
other helpful contributions to the team project.

Enhancement added: I added the ability for users to add, delete and edit cards.
Along with the usual CRUD operation, I also added a find and clear feature for the cards.

* Justification: A user should be able to modify a deck to customize the study session that the
user will experience. A find feature will help the user to locate the specific card especially when
they want to recall the question or answer to the specific question.

* Highlights: The CRUD operation has to work with the existing commands and
data structure in AB4. This was challenging as the `Undo` and `Redo` methods in the
original application leverages on the immutability of the data structure.
Also, our application maintains a state object which the UI is dependent on. As such, there is
also a need to ensure both the state of the application and the model is consistent with each other
after every command.

* Credits: The edit command has an auto-complete feature which was implemented
by my teammate  Wei Heng.

== Contributions to the User Guide
We had to update the original User Guide with new instructions for the different enhancements implemented.
The following is an extract from **TopDeck User Guide** that I have written.

(Start of extract)

=== Cards View

These commands are only available in cards view.
In this section, the active deck is the deck used in the `open` command.

==== Adding a card to the active deck: `add`

**Format**: `add q/QUESTION a/ANSWER [t/TAG]`

**Outcome**: Creates a new card with question and answers and
adds it to the current deck.

**Example**: `add q/Hello a/World t/TopDeckSample`

Below is an example of what the user should see upon the execution of the command:

Before:

image::card_ug_diagrams/add_card_1.png[width="800"]

After:

image::card_ug_diagrams/add_card_2.png[width="800"]

==== Editing a card in the active deck: `edit`

**Format**: `edit INDEX q/QUESTION a/ANSWER [t/TAG]`

**Outcome**: Edits the text of the card at `INDEX`.

**Example**: `edit 1 q/Edit Hello a/World t/Editted`

**Auto-Complete**: Instead of typing the whole command,
TopDeck also provides an auto-complete feature for the `edit` command.
Users need only type `edit INDEX` and TopDeck will fill up the commandline
for the user to edit accordingly.

==== Finding a card in the active deck by name: `find`

**Format**: `find KEYWORD [KEYWORD]...`

**Search for phrases**: TopDeck provides the user the ability to search for
specific question by searching for a whole phrase instead of only individual words.
This is done by putting `"` around `KEYWORD`.
The find command searches all `KEYWORD` between 2 `"`
and so there should not be any `"` character in `KEYWORD`.
Searching using phrases only searches the question.

**Outcome**: Lists all cards within the current deck containing `KEYWORD` in its text.

[NOTE]
`find` will only search for full-matching words. For e.g. `Animals` will not be found if
`animal` is used to search for it.

[CAUTION]
The entire phrase inside `"` will be matched word for word. For example, `find "Is there a question"`
will display the questions with the entire phrase `Is there a question` and the question
`Is there a question?` will not be matched due to the extra `?`

**Example**:

* `find Singapore`

Below is the result of executing this command:

=== Card management
==== Current implementation

Card management is currently facilitated by `Model` which implements the following operations:

* hasCard(Card card, Deck deck)
* addCard(Card card, Deck deck)
* removeCard(Card target, Deck deck)
* editCard(Card newCard, Deck deck)

The CRUD operations are exposed in the Model interface as `Model#addCard(Card card, Deck deck)`,
`Model#deleteCard(Card target, Deck deck)` and `Model#setCard(Card target, Card newCard, Deck deck)`.
For each operation, there are 2 objects that need to be updated namely, `VersionedTopDeck` and `CardsView`.
Each CRUD operation called by `ModelManager`can be broken down into the following steps:

.ModelManager#addCard(Card card, Deck deck) Activity Diagram
image::card_dg_fig/card_seq.png[width="800", caption="Figure 4.3.1 "]

Here is a code snippet for `VersionedTopDeck#addCard(Card newCard, Deck deck)` which shows the sequence
of functions carried out and returns the newly edited deck to `ModelManager`:

    public Deck addCard(Card card, Deck activeDeck) throws DuplicateCardException, DeckNotFoundException {
            requireAllNonNull(card, activeDeck);
            if (!decks.contains(activeDeck)) {
                throw new DeckNotFoundException();
            }
            if (activeDeck.hasCard(card)) {
                throw new DuplicateCardException();
            }
            Deck editedDeck = new Deck(activeDeck);
            editedDeck.addCard(card);
            decks.setDeck(activeDeck, editedDeck);
            .
            .
            .
            return editedDeck;
    }

[NOTE]
All other CRUD operations works similarly. Instead of `VersionedTopDeck.addCard(Card card, Deck activeDeck)`,
`VersionedTopDeck.deleteCard(Card target, Deck activeDeck)` or
`VersionedTopDeck.setCard(Card target, Card newCard, Deck activeDeck)` is called.

Given below is an example usage scenario of how the add operation works and how it
interacts with Undo/Redo:

Step 1. The user starts up the application and is in the `DecksView`. The user then
executes the `open 1` command to open the first deck(D1 in the figure). This should change the
`ViewState` in the `ModelManager` from `DeckView` to `CardsView` and causes
`CardsView.activeDeck` to point to the first deck as per figure 4.3.2. For more information, refer to
the Deck feature.

.Scenario 1
image::card_dg_fig/card_fig_1.png[width="800", caption="Figure 4.3.2 "]

Step 2. The user executes `add q/question a/answer` to add the new card into the current deck.
The `add` command is parsed and calls `Model#addCard(Card card, Deck deck)`.
`VersionedTopDeck(Card newCard, Deck deck)` is then called. D3 which is a copy
of D1 is created and the new card is added to D3. `VersionedTopDeck` is then updated
as per figure 4.3.3 by calling `UniqueDeckList.setDeck(Deck target, Deck editedDeck)`.

.Scenario 2
image::card_dg_fig/card_fig_2.png[width="800", caption="Figure 4.3.3 "]

Step 3. Next, the CardsView is updated creating a new `CardsView` that points to D3
as in figure 4.3.4

.Scenario 3
image::card_dg_fig/card_fig_3.png[width="800", caption="Figure 4.3.4 "]

Step 4. Once that is done, the `ModelManager.filteredItems` list and the UI is being updated to
reflect the change.

Below is a sequence diagram to illustrate the sequence of activities upon calling
`Model#addCard(Card card, Deck deck)`:

==== Design considerations

===== Aspect: Data structure of cards
* **Alternative 1(current choice):** Have a list of cards within each deck
** Pros: Allows for decks features such as import and export. Also, any search operation is
done within the deck only.
** Cons: There is a need to implement an extra `Deck` data structure and makes
the model more complicated.

* **Alternative 2(current choice):** Have a global list of cards with tags.
** Pros: Updating of UI will be easier as there is one global list only.
** Cons: In order to study the cards, the application has to search through the
global list to find the cards with the tags that we want to study. Organisation of
cards will also be messy as the only form of organisation for cards is through tagging.

* **Reason for choice 1:** Choice one was chosen as it would allow the user an extra layer of
organisation(`Deck` and `Tag`) when managing cards.

===== Aspect: How CRUD operation should work
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Recreate the CardViews after each operation
** Pros: Leverages on the current implementation of `VersionTopDeck` making it easier to
implement.
** Cons: There is a memory and operation overhead as a new `CardsView` is constantly being
created. Also, there is a need to refresh the UI at every update as the UI needs to render
the new `CardsView`.

* **Alternative 2:** Alter the card list in `CardsView` and the model upon each operation
** Pros: Only has to update the active Deck in CardsView and the model
** Cons: As `CardsView.activeDeck` can only reference to one deck only, the current Undo/Redo feature
will have to be re-implemented to store the previous commands and the object changed.

* **Reason for choice 1:** Choice one was chosen in order to retain the Undo/Redo function and to
leverage on the original architecture instead of changing it.
