== Overview

This document serves to document my contributions to TopDeck, the project I worked on
as part of our introductory software engineering module in NUS.
TopDeck is a flash card application built on top of the code from
https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY1819S1/addressbook-level4[Addressbook Level 4] (AB4).

== Summary of Contributions

This section summarises my key contributions to TopDeck:

* **Major Enhancement**: I added state to the user interface.
    - What it does: A stateful interface looks and behave differently depending
      on the state of the applicaton.
    - Justification: Having state in the user interface enhances usability in
      many ways. It offers a useful mental model for users by exposing features
      only when they are relevant to what a user is currently doing. It allows
      us to assign multiple related features to the same command word (since
      they can be disambiguated by state), minimizing the total number of unique
      commands words. It also leads to shorter commands in general since TopDeck
      does not have to request information from users that may be already be
      inferred from the current state.
    - Highlights: AB4 could not be readily adapted to support state because it
      was designed around assumptions that do not hold with a stateful user
      interface in full generality. AB4 has a static user interface that assumes
      there always exists a list of items. This assumption runs so deep that
      first-class access to `filteredList` and `selectedItem` is provided
      through the `Model` API. So I had to rewrite `Model`. I also had to modify
      many subsystems (such as parsing) along the pipeline of a typical command
      execution. As a result of my work, the rest of my team could work on their
      features independently and easily integrate their work through the new API
      I designed.

* **Minor Enhancement**: I added argument completion to the edit commands
      (the remaining exposition will focus on the edit card command).
    - What it does: The edit card command has an abbreviated form `edit INDEX`.
      This prefills the command box with an expanded command which, if submitted
      verbatim, leaves the card at `INDEX` unchanged.
    - Justification: This feature is meant to be a shortcut for making small
      edits. Suppose a user notices a typo in a question. Instead of retyping
      the entire question, they can quickly expand all arguments to the edit
      command and edit the question from there.
    - Highlights: Completion is a feature that interacts with the command box
      and is implemented by defining a new subclass of `CommandResult` that
      holds the string to be prefilled. In general, commands that need to
      interact with `UI` through `MainWindow` do so by returning an appropriate
      subclass of `CommandResult`.

== Quick Start

To get started with TopDeck:

.  Ensure you have Java version `9` or later installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `topdeck.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for TopDeck.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
+
image::Ui.png[width="790"]
+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.

Once you have set up TopDeck, you can try these commands:

* `add Capitals` : creates a new deck named "Capitals"
* `delete 3` : deletes the third deck in the list
* `exit` : exits the app

You may refer to <<commands>> for details of each command.

== User interface

TopDeck's interface is seperated into three different views.
By default, TopDeck starts in <<decksview,Decks View>>.

=== Decks View [[decksview]]

This view displays a list of the decks in your collection.
In decks view, you can:

- Create, edit and delete decks.
- Open a deck to view its contents. TopDeck will enter <<cardsview,cards view>>.
- Pick a deck to study. TopDeck will enter <<studyview,study view>>.

=== Cards View [[cardsview]]

This view displays the cards in a particular deck. In cards view, you can:

- Create, edit and delete cards in the deck.
- View your performance for specific cards.

=== Study View [[studyview]]

In this view you can study a deck of cards.

- Test your knowledge of the cards in your chosen deck
- Rate the difficulty of the cards.

== Commands [[commands]]

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user. +
  Example: In `add DECK_NAME`, `DECK_NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add Spanish`.
* Items in square brackets are optional. +
  Example: `q/QUESTION a/ANSWER [t/TAG]` can be used as `q/China a/Beijing t/Asia` or as `q/China a/Beijing`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used any number of times including zero. +
  Example: `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/Asia`, `t/trivia t/history` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order. +
  Example: If the command specifies `q/QUESTION a/ANSWER`, `q/QUESTION a/ANSWER` is also acceptable.

=== Stateful user interface
==== Introduction

TopDeck has a stateful user interface.
This means that the set of valid commands and their respective functionality
depend on the context of the application state.

For example, the command word `add` is "overloaded" with two capabilities:

1. In decks view, it adds a new deck: `add DECK_NAME`
2. In cards view, it adds a new card to a particular deck: `add q/QUESTION a/ANSWER`

It is the active state in TopDeck that resolves the actual command that is called.
Also, TopDeck does not request information from the user that is already implicit in the state
(e.g. the target deck in the second command).

The reasons for choosing to implement a stateful user interface are manifold.
Most importantly, it is necessary to support the implementation of study view which is stateful in nature.
A stateful user interface is also preferable to end users since it
requires less cognitive effort to operate by virtue of the fewer and shorter commands.

However, implementing state in full generality required nontrivial modifications to the AB4 architecture.
We will now describe how state is implemented in TopDeck.

==== Current implementation

States partition the functionalities that are exposed to users.
Hence, it is natural to consider distinct views in the user interface as separate states.
States in TopDeck correspond to the three possible views described in the user guide:
decks view, cards view and study view.

The following figure illustrates the transitions between these states.

"Cards view" --> [Close] "Decks view"
"Decks view" --> [Study] "Study view"
"Study view" -> [Finish study] "Decks view"
....
////

Each state implements a common interface `ViewState`
and holds transient data that is relevant only while the state is active.
For example, `CardsView` has a member `activeDeck` which holds a reference to the deck opened in decks view.
Commands in cards view such as `add` will then operate on this deck.

`ModelManager` owns the sole instance of `ViewState`.
Having only one instance of any state makes it trivial to enforce mutual exclusion.
The `Model` is also responsible for executing state transitions.
Each transition is exposed as a method in the `Model` API.
For example, `Model#changeDeck(Deck deck)` implements the transition from decks view to cards view.
As state entry is handled by the constructors of each state,
the implementation of a transition is as simple as constructing a new state object.

Technically, `Model#changeDeck(Deck deck)` can be called from any state, not just decks view.
This is a consequence of the design of `Model`.
The `Model` API is designed such that no state tracking is necessary.
All methods are expected to work regardless of the current state.
We assume that if a caller is capable of providing the required arguments to a method,
the method call is valid and expected.
This obviates the need for state-checking code in `ModelManager`.
