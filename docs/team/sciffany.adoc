== About the Project


For our Software Engineering module CS2103T, our team was tasked to modify or enhance the addressbook program into
our software of choice. We morphed it into TopDeck, a general purpose flash card application, which
allows users store flash cards in decks, and study these flash cards later.

My role was to design the Study Sessions. The following sections will describe my contributions in
greater detail, as well as the sections I've added to the user and developer guides with regards
to these enhancements.

== Summary of Contributions

This section shows a summary of my coding, documentation, and other helpful contributions to the team project.

**Enhancement added:** I added the Study View to study a deck of flash cards.

* What it does: The study session allows users to study a deck of cards. This is done by presenting
users with random questions from cards in a deck. Once the users have recalled their answers, they can choose to
reveal the answers. Cards do not repeat until the whole deck has been viewed.

* Justification: In order for a flash card application to aid users in memory tasks, there has to be a mode where the users
can test their own knowledge. This mode allows users to randomise viewing of questions and then
choose when to see the answers.

* Highlights: The ability to generate flash cards are found in a separate class, making it easy
for smarter study algorithms to be implemented in future. Several designs were considered to
ensure that the display would have minimal interactions with the internal state of the program.
The feature was challenging to implement because it entails stateful interactions. Another challenge
was creating a UI that made it intuitive for users to know whether they were viewing questions
or answers.


**Code Contributed:** Please view our github page to see the code that I have contributed.

**Other contributions**:

* Project management:
- There were a total of 4 releases, from version 1.1 to 1.4. I managed releases versions 1.2 to 1.3 (2 releases),
 together with the mid-versions (mid 1.2 and mid 1.3) on GitHub. This includes compiling the requirements needed at each stage,
 ensuring that all issues are resolved before each release, as well as building and releasing the binary.

 - I proposed a few meetings in order for our team to settle our roles before the release.


* Enhancements to existing features:
 - I added the ability to switch between Cards/Deck view to Study view and vice versa
 - I resolved checkStyle issues

* Documentation:
 - I made slight changes to the introduction to make it more comprehensible for non-technical users.
 - I alphabetised and split our Command Summary based on relevant categories.

* Community:
 - I reviewed pull requests for deck and card testing, and undoing of Card commands.
 - I contributed to finding the reasons why the Undo functionality was not working for Card Commands.
 - I contributed to planning how the final UI should look like.
 - I put up issues and enhancements to keep our team on track.
 - I helped my friends add screenshots of our UI for our documentation.
 - I gave our team a few tips on the IntelliJ workflow.

* Tools:
 - I made the project RepoSense Compatible

=== Study View [[studyviewc]]

Study view can be accessed using any of these commands:

* `study INDEX` from decks view
* `study` from cards view


In order to facilitate your study session,
Study view presents Flash Cards in two phases, namely <<qnphase, Question Phase>> and <<ansphase, Answer Phase>>.

==== Question Phase [[qnphase]]

Study view starts off in Question Phase, which displays the question in this user interface:

.Study view's Question Phase
image::study_ug_diagrams/question.png[width="800"]


As seen above, the question you have to answer is displayed in a dark blue flash card.


[NOTE]
Currently, questions are chosen this way: TopDeck shuffles the deck and displays cards one at a time until the entire deck
has been viewed. Topdeck repeats this endlessly until you choose to <<studyback, end your study session>>.

You may attempt the question by typing your answer into the Command Box,
which now doubles as an Answer Box.
 Once you're ready to see the answer, hit kbd:[Enter]. Your attempt will be recorded and
 TopDeck will enter Answer Phase.



==== Answer Phase [[ansphase]]

During this phase, you will see the answer to the earlier question in the following
user interface:

.Study view's Answer Phase
image::study_ug_diagrams/answer.png[width="800"]


As seen from the figure, the correct answer is displayed on a white flash card.
Your attempt is shown on top next to the card for your own comparison.

Additionally, a prompt asks you to rate the difficulty of that flash card.
You should input your rating into the Command Box.

Once you've typed in your rating, hit kbd:[Enter]. Your rating will be recorded and this
value will contribute to average difficulty statistic as seen in cards view.
At the same time, TopDeck will reenter Question Phase.

During both phases, the following commands are available to end your study session:

==== Returning to decks view: `back` [[studyback]]

**Format**: `back`

**Outcome**: Returns to decks view.

==== Opening the deck in cards view: `open`

**Format**: `open`

**Outcome**: Opens the deck in cards view.

=== Study view

==== Stateful implementation [[studystate]]

The purpose of a study session is to let users
test their knowledge of flash cards. This is done by randomly generating
 a card to be shown to users, presenting them with questions followed by answers
 in an alternating manner.

In order to facilitate the alternation between two states, the `StudyView` class holds two main variables:

* `currentCard` - the card which is currently being shown to the user.

* `currentStudyState` - an enum which can be either be `QUESTION` or `ANSWER`

These two  variables are continuously being altered to change the view
every time the user interacts with the program.

**User Commands** [[studyusercommands]]

The user can execute two types of commands to toggle value of `currentStudyState`. These are
`ShowAnswerCommand` and `GenerateQuestionCommand`.

Unlike other commands, the type of command executed is
inferred on the basis of  `currentStudyState` instead of the command word.
Upon command execution, `currentStudyState` is evaluated and is toggled to
 the opposite state. This behaviour is summarised below.

.Alternation of states summary
image::study_dg_diagrams/cyc.png[width="800"]

Besides toggling state, both commands also call
 other functions to fully support `StudyView` functionality as detailed below.

==== `ShowAnswerCommand` [[studyshow]]

This command is executed when users enter any string during question state.

This string is also the user's attempt for the question. Thus, `ShowAnswerCommand` has to store this string internally.
This is done by setting `userAnswer` variable in `StudyView` class.

.How ShowAnswerCommand works
image::study_dg_diagrams/show.png[width="800"]

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the `ShowAnswer` mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. User attempts the question by typing in any command. If in question state, and the command is not a preset command,
a `ShowAnswerCommand` object containing `userAnswer` is returned.

Step 2. When command is executed, user answer is stored internally in `userAnswer`
 variable of `StudyView`.

Step 3. `currentStudyState` in  `StudyView` is toggled to `QUESTION`.

Step 4. UI automatically changes to show answer as shown <<studyui,  here.>>

==== `GenerateQuestionCommand`

This command is executed when users enter ratings during answer state.

This represents his rating for the previous flash card shown.
Thus, `GenerateQuestionCommand` also needs to modify
ratings inside `Card` object. Besides that, it needs to modify `currentCard` to show a new card as well.


.How GenerateQuestionCommand works
image::study_dg_diagrams/gen.png[width="800"]


Given below is an example usage scenario and how the `ShowAnswer` mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. User enters a rating. If in answer state, and command is not a preset command,
and rating is between 1-5, a `GenerateQuestionCommand` object containing `int rating` is returned.

Step 2. When command is executed, `addRating()` is called to modify the difficulty of the
`currentCard`. This calls `addDifficulty()` in `Difficulty` class <<studydiff, detailed here>>.

Step 3. `generateCard()` in `StudyView` is called. `StudyView` calls its `DeckShuffler` to generate a card <<studyshuffle, detailed here>>.
`Card` returned by `DeckShuffler` is passed back to `StudyView` and studyView uses this to reset its own `currentCard`.

Step 4. `currentState` is set to QUESTION.

Step 5. UI changes to show question <<studyui, detailed here>>

**Summary of Changes**

The summary of variable changes to `StudyState` after running these commands is detailed below.

image::study_dg_diagrams/cycle.png[width="800"]

==== UI implementation [[studyui]]


`StudyView` makes  use of `ReadOnlyProperty` wrapper
to store variables which the UI has to display. This wrapper is chosen as it implements the `Observable` interface.

The UI listens for three things: the `studyState`, `userAnswer`, and `textShown`.

.UI Observer-Listener relationship diagram

The following details the changes to these observable variables.

[%header]
|===
|observableProperty variable | How this variable is modified | Changes in UI
|`currentStudyState` | Explained <<studyusercommands, previously>> | `sCard.pseudoClass` (flash card background color)
 `sQuestion.pseudoClass` (colour of flash card text)
`status.visibility` (whether or not to `userAnswer` and difficulty rating prompt is seen. Must be seen only during answer state)
|textShown | Calling `setCurrentCard()` and `setCurrentStudyState()` modifies `textShown` assign it a value which is either
`Question` or `Answer` of `currentCard`. | `sQuestion.text` (text written on flash card)
|userAnswer| Explained <<studyshow, previously>>  | `userLabel.text` (displays user's answer to flash card question displayed earlier)
|===

==== DeckShuffler brief overview

In order to generate a random `Card` object reference, `DeckShuffler` holds 3 variables:

* `activeDeck` - deck that it needs to choose cards from
* `shuffledDeck` - list of cards in `activeDeck` that has been shuffled by `Collections.shuffle()`
* `it` - a `Card` iterator that loops through cards in `shuffledDeck`.

When `generateCard()` is called, iterator calls `next`. If none, `shuffledDeck` is shuffled again and
iterator is set to `shuffledDeck.begin()`.

==== Difficulty class overview

The `Difficulty` object, a property of `Card`, has two variables:

* `totalRating`
* `numberOfAttempts`

When `addDifficulty(int rating)` is called, `rating` is added to `totalRating` and `noOfAttempts`
is incremented by 1. Other views can obtain average by obtaining quotient of these variables.

==== Design considerations

===== Aspect: How to store states

* **Alternative 1 (current choice): Using enums **
** Pros: Easy to implement. Makes sense as `QuestionState` and `AnswerState` do
not have intrinsic properties, besides the UI looks associated with each state.

** Cons: Unused variables in `StudyView`, such as `userAnswer` variable.

* **Alternative 2: polymorphism using `QuestionState` and `AnswerState` classess **

** Pros: Less unused variables. More organised.
** Cons: Requires larger structural changes.

I chose the first implementation as the problem of unused variables is minimal.
I do not foresee major changes to the way `QUESTION` and `ANSWER`  works in future.
There are not many possible reasons to store extra variables associated only with either state.

===== Aspect: How to implement UI modifications

* **Alternative 1 (current choice): Observable Properties **
** Pros: UI changes automatically. Concerns are separated as we
no longer need to concern ourselves with sending data to UI during internal state change.
** Cons: Less control over UI changes.


* **Alternative 2: Manual Modification of UI **
** Pros: Greater control over items to send to UI
** Cons: `StudyView` now also has to concern itself with UI arrangements

I chose the first implementation as UI changes happen all the time
but the UI is highly similar in both states. Thus, a few Observable variables
should suffice to achieve the intended appearance.
