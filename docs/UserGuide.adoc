== Introduction

TopDeck is a desktop app for anyone who relies on flash cards to memorise things.

TopDeck helps you digitise your flash cards and keeps them organised.
You can easily review your cards and TopDeck will track your performance.
Improve your memory without the hassle of managing a physical pile of cards!

TopDeck is optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI)
while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

If this sounds like the tool you have been looking for,
jump to <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

To get started with TopDeck:

.  Ensure you have Java version `9` or later installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `topdeck.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for TopDeck.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.

Once you have set up TopDeck, you can try these commands:

* `add Capitals` : creates a new deck named "Capitals"
* `delete 3` : deletes the third deck in the list

You may refer to <<commands>> for details of each command.
