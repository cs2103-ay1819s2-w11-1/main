== Introduction

TopDeck is a desktop app for managing and using flashcards that is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface(CLI)*
while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface(GUI). It is useful for those who want to memorise or learn anything through a desktop app.
Users start by creating, editing and managing decks of cards. Following, one can test oneself by starting a study session. If this is the study tool you
have been looking for, then jump to <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `9` or later installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `addressbook.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Address Book.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`list`* : lists all contacts
* **`add`**`n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01` : adds a contact named `John Doe` to the Address Book.
* **`delete`**`3` : deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.
