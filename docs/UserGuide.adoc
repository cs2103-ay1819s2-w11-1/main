== Introduction

TopDeck is a desktop app for managing and using flashcards that is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface(CLI)*
while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface(GUI). It is useful for those who want to memorise or learn anything through a desktop app.
Users start by creating, editing and managing decks of cards. Following, one can test oneself by starting a study session. If this is the study tool you
have been looking for, then jump to <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!
