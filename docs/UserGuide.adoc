== Introduction

TopDeck is a desktop app for anyone who relies on flash cards to memorise things.

TopDeck helps you digitise your flash cards and keeps them organised.
You can easily review your cards and TopDeck will track your performance.
Improve your memory without the hassle of managing a physical pile of cards!

TopDeck has a Command Line Interface (CLI), which means you interact with it by typing commands.
TopDeck can be operated entirely using the keyboard!

If this sounds like the tool you have been looking for,
jump to <<Quick start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick start

To get started with TopDeck:

.  Ensure you have Java version `9` or later installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `topdeck.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for TopDeck.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
+
.TopDeck's initial GUI
image::Ui.png[width="790"]
+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.

Once you have set up TopDeck, you can try these commands:

* `add Parseltongue` : creates a new deck named "Parseltongue"
* `delete 3` : deletes the third deck in the list
* `exit` : exits the app

You may refer to <<commands>> for details of each command.

== User interface

TopDeck's interface is very simple. It consists of four main areas - the
Menu Bar, the Command Box, the Results Display, and the Content Panel.

.Main areas in the user interface
image::gen_ug_diagrams/ui_annotate.png[width="600"]

Here are the uses of each part of the interface:

* Menu Bar: Provides access to general commands such as `exit` and `help` with dropdowns.
* Command Box: This is where you input commands to interact with the application.
* Results Display: This area shows the outcome of your commands.
* Content Panel: This is the main display area and changes depending on what you are doing.

TopDeck's functionality is separated into three distinct _views_ - decks view, cards view and study view.
The interface shown in the Content Panel and the commands available change depending on the view.
By default, TopDeck starts in decks view.

.Navigating the views in TopDeck
image::Navigation.png[width="800"]

The figure above provides a brief overview of the different views and shows how you may navigate between them.
In general, the commands `open`, `study` and `back` are used to navigate to cards view, study view and decks view respectively.
For more information about these commands, go to <<Commands>>.

The following sections will describe each view in more detail.

=== Decks view [[decksview]]

.Decks view
image::deck_ug_diagrams/deck.png[width=300,float=right]

Decks view displays a list of the decks in your collection.
The figure to the right shows a typical TopDeck session in decks view.

In decks view, you can:

- Create a new deck.
- Edit, delete, or search for an existing deck.
- Open a deck to view its contents. TopDeck will open the deck in <<cardsview,cards view>>.
- Pick a deck to study. TopDeck will use the deck in <<studyview,study view>>.
- Export a deck in your collection or import a deck from your computer to TopDeck.

You may find the corresponding commands for the features in decks view <<decksviewc,here>>.

=== Cards view [[cardsview]]

.Cards view
image::gen_ug_diagrams/cards.png[width="300",float=right]

Cards view displays the cards in a particular deck.
The figure to the right shows a typical TopDeck session in cards view.

In cards view, you can:

- Create a new card and add it to the deck.
- Edit, delete, or search for an existing card in the deck.
- View your past study performance for specific cards.

You may find the corresponding commands for the features in cards view <<cardsviewc,here>>.

=== Study view [[studyview]]

.Study view
image::gen_ug_diagrams/study.png[width="300",float="right"]

In study view, TopDeck helps you to study a particular deck.
The figure to the right shows a typical TopDeck session in study view.

The cards from a particular deck will be shown one at a time.
TopDeck will first show a question.
You may then reveal the answer and verify if it matches your answer.
Finally, you may rate how well you think you performed for that card before moving on to the next card.
TopDeck automates the bookkeeping for you.

You may find a more precise decription of the commands used in cards view <<cardsviewc,here>>.

== Commands [[commands]]

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user. +
  Example: In `add DECK_NAME`, `DECK_NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add Spanish`.
* Items in square brackets are optional. +
  Example: `q/QUESTION a/ANSWER [t/TAG]` can be used as `q/China a/Beijing t/Asia` or as `q/China a/Beijing`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used any number of times including zero. +
  Example: `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/Asia`, `t/trivia t/history` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order. +
  Example: If the command specifies `q/QUESTION a/ANSWER`, `a/ANSWER q/QUESTION` is also acceptable.
* If you provide multiple parameters for fields that do not support multiple arguments, only the last argument
  will be accepted. I.e. If you entered add n/nameOne n/nameTwo, the new deck will have the name "nameTwo".

for select in v2.0. Refer to <<Upcoming Features>> for more details.
// end::decksview[]

=== Cards view [[cardsviewc]]

These commands are only available in cards view.
In this section, the active deck is the deck used in the `open` command.

[NOTE]
The Footer Bar will continue to track the number of decks in the app.

==== Selecting a card in the active deck: `select`

image::card_ug_diagrams/add_card_1.png[width="800"]

After:

image::card_ug_diagrams/add_card_2.png[width="800"]

==== Deleting a card in the active deck: `delete`

**Format**: `delete INDEX`

**Outcome**: Deletes the card at `INDEX`

**Example**: `delete 2`

==== Editing a card in the active deck: `edit`

**Format**: `edit INDEX q/QUESTION a/ANSWER [t/TAG]`

**Outcome**: Edits the text of the card at `INDEX`.

**Example**: `edit 1 q/Edit Hello a/World t/Edited`

**Auto-Complete**: Instead of typing the whole command,
TopDeck also provides an auto-complete feature for the `edit` command.
Users need only type `edit INDEX` and TopDeck will fill up the commandline
for the user to edit accordingly.

[NOTE]
Edit will only edit the question, answer and tags of a card. It will not affect
the statistics of a card.

Below is a walk-through of the `edit` command:

Suppose the user adds a new card with a typo:

image::card_ug_diagrams/edit_card_1.png[width="800"]

The user can then retrieve the full detail of the card by simply typing
`edit 2` and pressing enter. The following would appear

image::card_ug_diagrams/edit_card_2.png[width="800"]

The user can then edit and correct the mistake made.

image::card_ug_diagrams/edit_card_3.png[width="800"]

This would be the end result:

image::card_ug_diagrams/edit_card_4.png[width="800"]

==== Finding a card in the active deck by name: `find`

**Format**: `find KEYWORD [KEYWORD]...`

**Search for phrases**: TopDeck provides the user the ability to search for
specific question by searching for a whole phrase instead of only individual words.
This is done by putting `"` around `KEYWORD`.
The find command searches all `KEYWORD` between 2 `"`
and so there should not be any `"` character in `KEYWORD`.
Searching using phrases only searches the question.

**Outcome**: Lists all cards within the current deck containing `KEYWORD` in its text.

[NOTE]
`find` will only search for full-matching words. For e.g. `Animals` will not be found if
`animal` is used to search for it.

[CAUTION]
The entire phrase inside `"` will be matched word for word. For example, `find "Is there a question"`
will display the questions with the entire phrase `Is there a question` and the question
`Is there a question?` will not be matched due to the extra `?`.

**Example**:

* `find Singapore`

Below is the result of executing this command:

image::card_ug_diagrams/find_card_1.png[width="800"]

* `find "When was Singapore founded?"`

Below is the result of executing this command:

image::card_ug_diagrams/find_card_2.png[width="800"]

==== Clearing all cards in the active deck: `clear`

**Format**: `clear`

**Outcome**: Clears all of the cards in the deck.

==== Listing all cards in the active deck: `list`

**Format**: `list`

**Outcome**: Displays a list of all cards in the deck.

==== Studying the active deck: `study`

**Format**: `study`

**Outcome**: Enters study view with the current deck.

==== Returning to decks view: `back`

**Format**: `back`

**Outcome**: Returns to decks view.

==== Adding a picture to a card [Coming in V2.0]

**Format**: `addImg INDEX IMAGEPATH`

**Outcome**: Adds the image as a question to the card at `INDEX`


=== Study View [[studyviewc]]

Study view can be accessed using any of these commands:

* `study INDEX` from decks view
* `study` from cards view


In order to facilitate your study session,
Study view presents Flash Cards in two phases, namely <<qnphase, Question Phase>> and <<ansphase, Answer Phase>>.

==== Question Phase [[qnphase]]

Study view starts off in Question Phase, which displays the question in this user interface:

.Study view's Question Phase
image::study_ug_diagrams/question.png[width="600"]


As seen above, the question to be answered is displayed in a dark blue flash card.


[NOTE]
Currently, questions are chosen this way: TopDeck shuffles the deck and displays cards one at a time until the entire deck
has been viewed. Topdeck repeats this endlessly until you choose to <<studyback, end your study session>>.

You may attempt the question by typing your answer into the Command Box,
which now doubles as an Answer Box.
 Once you're ready to see the answer, hit kbd:[Enter]. Your attempt will be recorded and
 TopDeck will enter Answer Phase.



==== Answer Phase [[ansphase]]

During this phase, you will see the answer to the earlier question in the following
user interface:

.Study view's Answer Phase
image::study_ug_diagrams/answer.png[width="800"]


As seen from the figure, the correct answer is displayed on a white flash card.
Your attempt is shown on top next to the card for your own comparison.

Additionally, a prompt asks you to rate the difficulty of that flash card.
You should input your rating into the Command Box which now doubles as a Rating Box.

Once you've typed in your rating, hit kbd:[Enter]. Your rating will be recorded and this
value will contribute to average difficulty statistic seen in cards view.
Immediately after that, TopDeck will reenter Question Phase.

[NOTE]
Your rating can be any integer between 1-5. You may type it together with other words, e.g.
"1 easy" but the program will only look at the first word/integer.

During both phases, the following commands are available to end your study session:

==== Returning to decks view: `back` [[studyback]]

**Format**: `back`

**Outcome**: Returns to decks view.

==== Opening the deck in cards view: `open`

**Format**: `open`

**Outcome**: Opens the deck in cards view.

[NOTE]
The command can include other words e.g.
"open sesame", but as long as your command's first word is a command word,
running the commands will be prioritised.

=== Global commands

These commands are available in all views.

==== Listing entered commands : `history`

**Format**: `history`

**Outcome**: Lists all the commands that you have entered in reverse chronological order

[NOTE]
====
Pressing the kbd:[&uarr;] and kbd:[&darr;] arrows will display the previous and next input respectively in the command box.
====

==== viewing help : `help`

**Format**: `help`

**Outcome**: Displays information regarding commands


==== Exiting the program : `exit`

**Format**: `exit`

**Outcome**: Exits the program


==== Clearing all entries : `clear`

**Format**: `clear`

**Outcome**: Clears all entries in TopDeck


[NOTE]
====
Clearing TopDeck is disabled in study view.
====


==== Undoing a command : `undo`

**Format**: `undo`

**Outcome**: Restores TopDeck to the state before the previous change.

**Examples**:

* _In decks view_ +
`delete 1` +
`undo` (undos `delete 1`) +

* _In cards view_ +
`delete 1` +
`add q/Russia a/Moscow` +
`undo` (undos `add`) +
`undo` (undos `delete`) +

[NOTE]
====
Undoing is disabled in study view.
====

==== Redoing a command : `redo`

**Format**: `redo`

**Outcome**: Restores the TopDeck to the state before an `undo`.

**Examples**:

* `delete 1` +
`undo` (undos `delete 1`) +
`redo` (redos `delete 1`) +

* `delete 1` +
`redo` +
The `redo` command fails as there is no undone state to restore.

* _In cards view_ +
`delete 1` +
`add q/Panama a/Panama` +
`undo` (undos `add`) +
`undo` (undos `delete`) +
`redo` (redos `delete`) +
`redo` (redos `add`) +



[NOTE]
====
Redoing is disabled in study view.
====



==== Saving your data

TopDeck data is saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. +
There is no need to save manually.

== FAQ

*Q*: How do I transfer my data to another Computer? +
*A*: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous TopDeck folder.

== Glossary

**Card**: Flash cards in TopDeck are called cards. Each card contains a question-answer pair.
When studying, TopDeck will show the question, and the answer will be revealed when prompted by the user.

**Deck**: A deck is a collection of cards that are studied together.
