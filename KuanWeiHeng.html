<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>My team and I were tasked to with morphing a basic commandline interface addressbook for our
so!ware engineering project. We decided to morph the application into a Flashcard management
application called TopDeck TopDeck is a user-friendly tool that aims to help users better memorise any
content that they desire. Users can use it to learn a language, remember a math formula or simply
recall an answer to a question.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One of the key features of our application is the simplicity that we would like
to provide out user in terms of the commands and this meant that we had to implement states for
different part of the application namely, a state for card management, decks management and
one for studying the cards. I was in charge of implementing this states and decided to implement it
using polymorphism.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>This section shows a summary of my coding, documentation, and other helpful contributions to the team project.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Enhancement added:</strong> I modified the architecture of our software such that
stateful interface is supported. I added the state management features in the application so that the
same commands given by the user can be overloaded. For example, <code>add</code> can mean both
adding a deck or a card depending on which state the app is currently in.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Justification: A user should be able to execute simple commands easily instead of having
to give a context to the application.</p>

<h4 id="introduction"><a class="link" href="#introduction">7.1.1. Introduction</a></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>TopDeck has a stateful user interface.
This means that the set of valid commands and their respective functionality
depend on the context of the application state.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, the command word <code>add</code> is "overloaded" with two capabilities:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>In decks view, it adds a new deck: <code>add DECK_NAME</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In cards view, it adds a new card to a particular deck: <code>add q/QUESTION a/ANSWER</code></p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is the active state in TopDeck that resolves the actual command that is called.
Also, TopDeck does not request information from the user that is already implicit in the state
(e.g. the target deck in the second command).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The reasons for choosing to implement a stateful user interface are manifold.
Most importantly, it is necessary to support the implementation of study view which is stateful in nature.
A stateful user interface is also preferable to end users since it
requires less cognitive effort to operate by virtue of the fewer and shorter commands.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, implementing state in full generality required nontrivial modifications to the AB4 architecture.
We will now describe how state is implemented in TopDeck.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="current-implementation"><a class="link" href="#current-implementation">7.1.2. Current implementation</a></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>States partition the functionalities that are exposed to users.
Hence, it is natural to consider distinct views in the user interface as separate states.
States in TopDeck correspond to the three possible views described in the user guide:
decks view, cards view and study view.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The following figure illustrates the transitions between these states.</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/state_diagram.png" alt="state diagram">
</div>
<div class="title">Figure 1. State diagram for TopDeck</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Each state implements a common interface <code>ViewState</code>
and holds transient data that is relevant only while the state is active.
For example, <code>CardsView</code> has a member <code>activeDeck</code> which holds a reference to the deck opened in decks view.
Commands in cards view such as <code>add</code> will then operate on this deck.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><code>ModelManager</code> owns the sole instance of <code>ViewState</code>.
Having only one instance of any state makes it trivial to enforce mutual exclusion.
The <code>Model</code> is also responsible for executing state transitions.
Each transition is exposed as a method in the <code>Model</code> API.
For example, <code>Model#changeDeck(Deck deck)</code> implements the transition from decks view to cards view.
As state entry is handled by the constructors of each state,
the implementation of a transition is as simple as constructing a new state object.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Technically, <code>Model#changeDeck(Deck deck)</code> can be called from any state, not just decks view.
This is a consequence of the design of <code>Model</code>.
The <code>Model</code> API is designed such that no state tracking is necessary.
All methods are expected to work regardless of the current state.
We assume that if a caller is capable of providing the required arguments to a method,
the method call is valid and expected.
This obviates the need for state-checking code in <code>ModelManager</code>.</p>
